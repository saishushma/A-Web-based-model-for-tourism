Kerala is not only a beautiful destination in Southern India known for its scenic beaches and serene backwaters. Kerala has gained international attention for Medical Tourism and is becoming a popular international medical tourism destination with its world class hospitals.

Kerala is famous for its alternative medical therapies such as Ayurveda, which help to rejuvenate and revitalize the body. What many tourists have now discovered is that Kerala has a pool of trained doctors and nurses and an excellent network of hospitals that offer international standard treatments at very affordable prices. Previously Indians working abroad, such as residents of Kerala working in the Persian Gulf countries, would return to India for medical treatment. Now International patients too have realized the advantages of traveling to Kerala and the medical tourism industry at hospitals and Ayurvedic centres in Kerala has begun to take off in a big way. 

Faced with exorbitant fees for procedures such as cardiac surgery, dentistry and cosmetic surgery in their home countries, patients from the West and the Middle East have begun looking at India and Kerala Hospitals in particular. 

Indian doctors have established themselves as highly skilled and conscientious caregivers worldwide. Many doctors who have trained or worked abroad have returned to India to work here. Their reputation has led to the growth of the Medical Tourism industry in Hospitals in Kerala. Kerala Travel Tourism offers tour packages that combine medical treatment with a restful holiday in Kerala India. The world-class hospital facilities, pre and post-operative care and pleasant climate make your medical treatment and recovery in Kerala a positive experience.

Major medical tourism promoting hospitals in Kerala are Lifeline Hospital,Kerala and Malabar Institute of Medical Sciences, Calicut, Kerala, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Cochin, Kerala and Ayurvedic Centre of Kerala. These hospitals have been accredited by national and international hospital accreditation bodies and are well equipped to take medical and personal care of International Patients.

Kerala is also well placed for the convenience of medical travelers. It is well connected to major air hubs, has some of the good shopping places, accommodation outside the hospital is not costly and tourist vehicles are freely available to move about. Plenty of excursion options are also available. </p>
<h4>AYURVEDAM</h4>
<p>Kerala possesses an unbroken tradition of Ayurveda that has surpassed many invasions and intrusions both foreign and native. For hundreds of years the Ayurveda Vaidyas (traditional practitioners of Ayurveda) were almost the only solution for people seeking healing from every kind of disease in Kerala. The legendary eight families of Vaidyas (Ashta vaidyas) and their successors treated the entire state for centuries. Unlike the other Indian states the status of Ayurveda in Kerala is not that an alternative but is main stream. In fact, today, Kerala is the only State in India which practices this system of medicine with absolute dedication.

Being the only resort of treatment for the people, the Vaidyars of Kerala were challenged to interpret the theories of Ayurveda and adapt them actively into effective healing systems in everyday life. Thus almost all the contemporary procedures and protocols of Ayurveda have evolved in and around Kerala.
he equable climate, natural abundance of forests and the cool Monsoon season of Kerala are best suited for Ayurveda's curative and restorative packages. Kerala is perhaps one of the few places on Earth where a temperature of 24-28 degrees is maintained during a period of continuous rain. This prevalence of moisture in the air and on the surface of the skin makes it the ideal place for natural medicines to work at their highest levels of potency. The land is also blessed with innumerous medicinal plants and provides the continuity and consistency of Ayurveda medicines needed for effective treatment procedures. The same herbs with the same potency are available year after year across every season. The rich alkaloid content of the soil enhances the intensity and potency of many Ayurvedic medicines when compared to places with a different soil constitution.
